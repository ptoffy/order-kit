# OrderKit


This repository contains the source code for the TAW 2023 project. The project is a web application for managing orders in a restaurant. 

## Stack
The application is built using:
 - [Angular](https://angular.io/) as the frontend framework
 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as the backend framework with:
   - [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as routing service
   - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as the database driver

## Running the application
The application is designed to be run using `docker-compose`:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
This will start the frontend, backend and database services. The frontend will be available at `localhost:4200` and the backend at `localhost:3000`.

> :warning: The backend application relies on an `.env` file to set environment variables. This file is not included in the repository for security reasons. 
If you want to run the application locally, you will need to create this file following the `.env.example` file.

## Security

The application uses [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/) to authenticate users. The tokens are generated by the backend and stored in a safe way:
- The token's payload and header are stored in the browser's local storage, which the client can access to check the token's validity
- The token's signature is stored in a http-only cookie, which the client cannot access. This cookie is sent to the backend with every request, so the backend can verify the token's validity
